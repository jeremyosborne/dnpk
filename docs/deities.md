# Deities

Deities provide the reason for the season, and blood shed, and gameplay, and bonuses to your units, and smiting of opposing units! While game rules and modifications should allow for any configuration of deities, or even the lack thereof, our digital beings within their digital cultures are assumed to be polytheistic and that these divine beings are a true part of life. They affect the world through their avatars, their powers, and the occasional corporeal appearance.
