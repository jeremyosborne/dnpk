# Deities

Deities provide the reason for the season, and blood shed, and gameplay, and bonuses to your units, and smiting of opposing units! While game rules and modifications should allow for any configuration of deities, or even the lack thereof, our digital beings within their digital cultures are assumed to be polytheistic and that these divine beings are a true part of life. They affect the world through their avatars, their powers, and the occasional corporeal appearance.

* `Dragur`: Trickster god of many faces.
* `Ha-t'an`: Formless being binding the cosmos. Usually a being in the background, worshipped by those when times feel out of balance.
* `Hazalo-Moxa`: God of anger, passion, love, and war.
* `Im`: Formless being who begat the universe and the more day-to-day relatable deities.
* `Loahn Anno`: Goddess of change, triumph, and novelty. Half-sister and rival to the natural-order goddess of Lokti and Tlorok. Counter to Ha-t'an, often selfishly worshipped by those oppressed or lost to boredom.
* `Lokti`: Goddess of life and order, twin sister of Tlorok.
* `Tlorok`: Goddess of death and cleansing, twin sister of Lokti.
* `Xiczakr`: Goddess of prosperity, civility, and justice.
