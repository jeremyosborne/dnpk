# Shrines and blessings

Shrines provide blessings to armies that visit them. The blessing conveys a bonus
to individual units and are a way of taking cheap units and making them competitive,
at the cost of time needed to travel to the temple. Podunk cities can become
strategically important if next to a shrine.

They are modeled in the game as normal `effects` and assumed to be a `brawn`
bonus of `+1`, and they contain a `metadata.name` of the deity granting the
bonus.

Each shrine will be controlled by a unique deity in a game, and an army may
only have blessings from distinct deities. No sitting at a temple and praying
turn after turn to get super buff units.
