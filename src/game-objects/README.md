# Game objects

Wrappers, functions, probably even the occasionally `class` (wow!) for working with the raw game object data. They are only backed by `config-game-objects` for times when we want to make variations of the game objects user/modder configurable.

The application should make use of `game-objects` and not directly make use of `config-game-objects`.
