# Game objects

Wrappers, functions, probably even the occasionally `class` (wow!) for building and working with in-game entities.

Some entities will be modifiable and will need access to `data-source-moddables`, others will  not.

## Dev Notes

* Modules and submodules do not keep internal state.
