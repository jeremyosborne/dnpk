# dice

Provide specific dice rolling mechanics in the game. Nothing special, could all be done with explicit calls to randint() here and there, but this allows for concepts like a standard battle dice to be used.

## TODO

- [ ] Standard is relative to the battle module, and in particular violence. Should this be moved to the battle code when we do the battle rewrite?
- [ ] Are we ever going to need other types of named dice? If not, then the above comment is more relevant to consider.
