# Schemas

Data type definitions for objects used in the game.

All data structures are defined and pontificated as [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).

Define schemas as `*.schema.json` files and then make use of them by importing this module.

The schemas should likely be isolated to the `data` package scope and will likely not need to be used outside of the greater package.
